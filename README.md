### Backend API - AdonisJs (v5) + PostgreSQL

> This is only the backend application to serve the server-side logics and processed APIs to the client applications like website or mobile apps.

###### Motivation

When I was preparing myself and trying to make some good portfolios that can make impressions, I thought about many like e-commerce, rental, and some others as quite popular among new developers like me.

Later I decided to make some little & unique things from others to make a small difference. Then I choose this idea. Because, its quite different from any regular new developers portfolio showcase.

###### More information

This application serves `JSON` API only. I'm using a very good node.js based framework called `AdonisJs` and `PostgreSQL` database for this.

```yml
Runtime: Nodejs (>= 18.x) :: LTS preferred
Framework: AdonisJs (v5)
Databases: [
  PostgreSQL,
  Redis,
]
DbDriver: Lucid ORM (knex.js)
TypeSafe: YES <TypeScript>
Authentication: @adonisjs/auth
Authorization: @adonisjs/bouncer (policy)
Email: @adonisjs/mailer (smtp) + mjml

```

> Note: This is a portfolio or prototype based backend api based application with NodeJs-stack. For more info, please contact me @mahabubx7 [`iosmahabub@gmail.com`]
